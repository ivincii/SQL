-- Q1) Write the SQL to determine which customers meet all of the following conditions:
-- condition a) Purchased fewer than 3 units of products that are product type 'Electronics' before 2013 
-- condition b) Spent less than $30 on Kitchen products between 1999 and 2008

-- Q2) Write the SQL query to determine the top 6 states for total dollars spend on 
--products of type 'garden' for people younger than 33 years old at the time of purchase

-- Q3) Write the SQL to label and count the number of customers that meet the following conditions:
--		a) Purchased fewer than 20 units of 'automotive' products lifetime AND spent less than $800 lifetime of product type 'kitchen', label them 'Blue'
--		b) Purchased between 20 and 30 units of 'automotive' products lifetime AND spent less than $800 lifetime of product type 'kitchen', label them 'Green'
--		c) Purchased between 31 and 45 units of 'automotive' products lifetime AND spent less than $800 lifetime of product type 'kitchen', label them 'Orange'
--		d) Purchased between 46 and 60 units of 'automotive' products lifetime AND spent BETWEEN $801 and $3000 lifetime of product type 'kitchen', label them 'Purple'
--		e) Else 'Unknown'
-- HINT: this is best written with a CASE statement drawing from 2 subqueries(!!) that each have an aggregated alias like 'AutoUnits' and 'TotalBucksKitchen'
